## Prerequisites
- install `dotnet` SDK - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial/install

## Description
I based this simple implementation on the official tutorial: "
ASP.NET Tutorial - Hello World in 10 minutes" https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/hello-world-tutorial//intro.
I want to show how you can add and use Handsontable in your `dotnet mvc` project.

I used the newest Handsontable and Axios libraries. Axios provides a powerful API to communicate with the server.

I showed two simple actions - how to load data after page load and how to collect changes on the server-side.

Any other functionalities like:
- server-side search,
- inserting new rows,
- removing rows,
might work analogously.
